# Hello

My name is Jamie Gaehring (he/him). 

I am a software developer specializing in resilient systems for capturing agricultural data. I maintain farmOS Field Kit, an offline-first, multi-platform app, optimized for the challenging environment of daily farm operations.

For more background on how I became involved with agriculture and software, as well as what inspires my work, you can read [my story](/blog/my-story).
