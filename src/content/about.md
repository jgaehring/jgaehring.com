# Hello

My name is Jamie Gaehring (he/him). 

I am a free software maintainer, consultant, and community organizer.

My most recent work with the [Runrig] project has focused on developing the
tools, methods, and social relations needed to sustain autonomous farming and
food communities. I am also a maintainer of several open source projects in the
[farmOS] ecosystem, an organizing member for the [Gathering for Open
Agricultural Technology] (GOAT), and active contributor to [OpenTEAM]'s
Technology and Human Centered Design working groups.

Prior to my work as a software developer, I worked for 20 years as a farm
laborer, farmers market manager, on-farm communications advisor, and the many ad
hoc roles that fill the gap between New York City's urban food systems and the
outlying patchwork of regional farms and small food producers.

For more background on how I became involved with agriculture and software, as
well as what inspires my work, you can read [my story].
