# Hello

My name is Jamie Gaehring (he/him). 

I am a software engineer specializing in resilient systems for capturing agricultural data. I maintain [farmOS Field Kit](https://farmos.org/guide/app/), an offline-first, progressive web app, optimized for the challenging environment of the modern farm.

Prior to my work with farmOS, I spent 10 years at GrowNYC, managing operations and publicity for the Union Square Greenmarket. Although I'm based in New York City, I've worked periodically at various farms in southern New Jersey and Upstate New York. I'm also an organizing member of [GOAT](http://goatech.org) (Gathering for Open Agricultural Technology).

For more background on how I became involved with agriculture and software, as well as what inspires my work, you can read [my story](/blog/my-story).
