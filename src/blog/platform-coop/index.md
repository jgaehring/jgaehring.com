Over the last few months, Laurie Wayne of [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/) and I have been talking with people I know through [farmOS](https://farmos.org), Chris Newman's [Skywoman group](https://discord.gg/NxB7JMfpwQ), the [Gathering for Open Agricultural Technology (GOAT)](http://goatech.org) and other online spaces, about conducting a series of events around food sovereignty, cooperative agriculture and technology. I've done a poor job at communicating the overall theme for this series, partly because I wasn't sure what the best format and venue for it would be, and partly because I was reluctant to center my own personal motivations for convening the events in the first place. But since I've finally convinced enough brave souls to loan their knowledge and considerable expertise to this project — and I can't stress enough how truly impressive that expertise is — I figured I might as well come out with it and let everyone know what all this is driving at.

## The 'What?'
The initial project will center around a series of technical interviews with people who run aggregation services, either as a multi-farm CSA or a more centralized food hub, where product from multiple farms is pooled and sold through one or more distribution channels. The primary outcome will be a collection of interview materials and design documents, made freely available under Creative Commons or a similar license, which will map each interviewee's user journey and the information architecture that underlies their operation.

The first two participants who have agreed to be interviewed are Kip Curtis from Ohio State University, who has been developing the [Microfarm Project](https://osumarion.osu.edu/alumni-initiatives/initiatives/microfarm.html) together with the [Richland Gro-Op](https://richlandgro-op.com/), and Tianna Kennedy from [Star Route Farm](http://www.starroutefarmny.com/) in Charlotteville, NY, who also owns and operates [the 607 CSA](https://www.the607csa.com/info) serving dozens of farms and independent food producers in the Hudson Valley.

Nate Chang, a User Experience Designer and Data Strategist, has graciously volunteered to guide the technical interviews, with additional input from other designers and engineers in the Skywoman community, which is where these first interviews will be hosted. I encourage any and all who are interested to attend, but I'll warn that these sessions will indeed be technical in nature, with an aim towards forming a rigorous model of the aggregation process, so it may be a bit of a snoozer if that's not your jam.

If you're not exactly into all the technical minutiae, fear not; I also hope to share these materials and insights with a broader audience as a capstone to the initial round of interviews; something in the form of a public presentation, which will provide a more digestible and high-level view of what we learn. So stay tuned for that!

## The 'Why?'
While my near-term goal with these interviews is to bring into focus some attainable software solutions that would aid these aggregation services, the long-term goal is what I've taken to calling "The Holy Grail of Ag-Tech", namely: __a software system that can connect detailed production data to aggregation, sales and marketing services — and vice versa__. So, as an example, once a farmer enters a seeding date and quantity into their crop plan, that kicks off a chain reaction that starts populating additional tables with days-to-harvest, projected yields and inventories, sales estimates, etc. Similarly, if a producer knows how many people bought vegetable shares for the coming year's CSA, they can estimate how many row feet they'll need to plant for each crop. Bidirectional data flow is the key, which is why in some conversations I've referred to this as the "Projection API," though the concept is more general than a single application or service.

I've experienced the need for this myself, working on diversified vegetable and specialty crop farms, and it's something I hear reiterated time and again on the farmOS forum, in the Skywoman Discord, and growers I know from my days at the Union Square Greenmarket. I got a whole bag o' ideas and technical concepts for how this can be achieved, but I think it's important to base this in design and the needs of real food producers and distributors, not just theory. This is why technical interviews, with people already operating successful aggregations services like Richland Gro-Op and the 607 CSA, seems like the natural first step.

## OK, but _really_ why???
Whether they intend to deliver on near- or long-term goals, if these software projects have a prayer of getting off the ground (and being maintained), they will require more resources, funding and stakeholder commitment than a purely volunteer project can provide. But I don't want to go the route of some VC-funded startup or non-profit always beholden to the next grant. Nor do I think that's actually the most effective way to go about it.

Instead, I'm hoping this could be the germ of what has recently been termed a "platform cooperative". A [platform coop](https://platform.coop/) is just a tech platform, similar to how Facebook, AirBNB, Uber, etc, insist they're ["just platforms"](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/02/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-platform-publisher-lawsuit), except it is __a tech platform that is entirely worker- and/or user-owned__. Imagine something like DoorDash, but if the website itself was operated as a cooperative with 100% of profits and decision-making power controlled by the drivers themselves. Wherever more software development was required, they would be the ones to decide what features were built, who got hired to do it, and how the costs and revenues from such development would be shared. There are already some excellent examples of platform coops, like [CoopCycle](https://coopcycle.org/en/) in France, [FairBNB](https://fairbnb.coop/) and the NYC [Drivers Cooperative](https://drivers.coop/).

For farms and food hubs, this could take many forms, and may even entail multiple platform coops, each serving a particular region or a niche market. There could also be different ways of sharing ownership between farmers, retailers and consumers, not to mention the engineers themselves, who are responsible building and maintaining the software and servers it all depends upon.

I truly believe that the development of such resilient systems is something that can only be achieved through a radically cooperative enterprise. The data underpinning the networks of agricultural production and food distribution is so inextricably complex, and it is no accident that this complexity only skyrockets in the context of operations that actually take care of the people, land and overall ecology involved in feeding a community. It is a reflection of the social and cultural complexities underpinning how we eat, grow and relate to one another and our environment. I don't think there can be a just and equitable software system, capable of handling all that informational complexity, if it doesn't have social and ecological cooperation baked right into the design and development of the software itself.

## Event Schedule
All of that will of course take time, and will certainly need to evolve in shape and form if it has any hope of ever being put into practice, but I hope if you're reading this and interested you'll have a better idea what these initial events are about and what they're aiming for.

I'll update this space when the event schedule is finalized, and I hope to see you there!
